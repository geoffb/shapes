# Shapes

Shoot the angry rotating shapes before they run into you! Three exotic space themed backgrounds!

You start with 3 lives and 3 bombs. Bombs will destroy all enemy shapes on the screen. Use them wisely!

Each enemy shape has a different behavior. Learn to use this to your advantage.

**Controls:** W,A,S,D to move, Mouse to aim, Left Mouse button to fire. Space detonates a bomb.

This isn't meant to be a complete game. It's a prototype and buggy. That said, it _should_ be playable in most decent browsers.
